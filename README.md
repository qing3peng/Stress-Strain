# Stress-Strain
Stress-strain curve plotting and data analysis

 This python3 script plot_tensile_stress_strain.py is a post-processing code 
 for tensile simulation. The main tasks are following: 

    1. plot the stress-strain curve 
    2. linear fitting to found out the Young's modulus 
    3. find the ultimate tensile strength
    4. find the tensile toughness 
    5. find the failure strain
 
 For ease of your understanding, I tried to add as more comments as I can
 Please adopt it for your system/projets
