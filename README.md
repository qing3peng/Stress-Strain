# Stress-Strain
Stress-strain curve plotting and data analysis

 This python3 script plot_tensile_stress_strain.py is a post-processing code 
 for tensile simulation. The main tasks are follows: 

#    1. plot the stress-strain curve 
#    2. linear fit to obtain the Young's modulus 
#    3. get the ultimate tensile strength
#    4. integration to obtain the tensile toughness 
#    5. determin the failure strain
